* Purpose of this analysis: Devise a scalable and high-quality analytical method to accomodate this extensive amount of data (over 80k rows of data in combined datasets). PostgreSQL and Power BI Visuals are being used to pull out meaningful information and present them in an easy to understand format using a mobile-friendly Power BI Dashboard. Key metrics including but not limited to genre preferences, movie rankings, viewership patterns, viewer ratings, and top actors/actresses can be explored using SQL queries and subqueries as needed. Power BI service's dashboard sharing feature is particularly useful since it enables interactive exploration of the data which allows Netflix stakeholders to pursue actionable insights via visually appealing charts, graphs, and interactive data visualizations.
